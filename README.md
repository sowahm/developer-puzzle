## Code Review for Master Branch

### What is done well?
1. Stocks and Stocks-api folders are seperated.
2. Utility components are clearly marked in the libs folder.
3. Standard requirements met.
  
### What would you change?
1. I would change the folder structure to multiple-module architecture.
2. I would also look into syntax conventions and application structure.
